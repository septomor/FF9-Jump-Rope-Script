# FF9 Jump Rope Script


// Made 9/24/17, by Septomor/ByPrinciple

// Updated 6/7/2020 with QueueTip's script with user friendliness in mind

// This script is used to help get people the Final Fantasy 9 Hail to the King trophy on PS4

// 

// How to use:

//  1. Have Vivi talk to the girls and standing ready to take his first jump

//  2. Run jump.ahk by double clicking 

//  3. Press Start button

//  4. Press 'ctrl + esc' on your keyboard to close script

//  5. Wait for 1,000 jumps

//

// How to improve innacuracies:

//  1. Run jump.ahk as administrator

// 

// That is it, hopefully
